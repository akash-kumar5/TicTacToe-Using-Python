# TicTacToe-Using-Python

This is a Python implementation of the classic game, Tic Tac Toe. The objective of the game is to get three X's or O's in a row, either vertically, horizontally or diagonally.

In this implementation, players will play against each other on a 3x3 grid board. The game begins with an empty board and the first player will place their marker (either X or O) on any empty square of the board. The second player will then place their marker, and so on. The game ends when either a player gets three of their markers in a row, or all squares on the board have been filled without a winner.

The game is built using Python programming language, and utilizes functions and conditional statements to keep track of the board and check for a winner. It includes user prompts and input validation to ensure smooth gameplay.

# Requirements
This implementation requires Python 3 to be installed on the system.

# How to Play
To start playing the game, simply run the tictactoe.py file in your terminal:

# Copy code
python tictactoe.py
You will be prompted to enter the names of the two players. Player 1 will be assigned the X marker and player 2 will be assigned the O marker. The game will then begin, and the current state of the board will be displayed.

Players will be prompted to enter their moves by specifying the row and column of the square they wish to place their marker. For example, the top-left square is (1,1) and the bottom-right square is (3,3).

# Additional Features
In addition to the basic gameplay, this implementation includes the following features:

Track and display the current player's turn
Option to restart the game at any time
Input validation to prevent invalid moves and entries
A customizable board size (default is 3x3)

# Acknowledgements
This implementation was built using Python and inspiration was taken from other Tic Tac Toe games available online.
